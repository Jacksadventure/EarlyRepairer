# How to Fix ini.c to Support Input from /dev/fd/3 (Pipe)

**Problem:**  
The parser closes the file descriptor (v) immediately after reading the input into a buffer, before parsing. This can cause issues when the input is a pipe (as with /dev/fd/3), leading to incomplete reads or failures when used with tools like `earleyrepairer_dev`.

**Solution:**  
Only close the file descriptor after all parsing is complete.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open `ini.c` in your editor.**

2. **Locate this block in `main`:**
   ```c
   char* string = read_input();
   if (argc > 1) {
       fclose(v);
   }
   //printf(string);
   //int num = 999;
   //num = ini_parse_string(string, handler, &config);
   ```

3. **Move the `fclose(v);` line to after all parsing is complete.**
   - The goal is to ensure the file descriptor is not closed until after `ini_parse_string` and all related processing is done.

4. **The modified block should look like this:**
   ```c
   char* string = read_input();
   //printf(string);
   //int num = 999;
   //num = ini_parse_string(string, handler, &config);

   // ... rest of your code for parsing and output ...

   if (argc > 1) {
       fclose(v);
   }
   ```

5. **Save the file.**

6. **Recompile the parser:**
   - In the `project/erepair-subjects/ini` directory, run:
     ```
     make
     ```
   - Or, if you build manually:
     ```
     gcc -o ini ini.c
     ```

7. **Test the fix:**
   - Run `earleyrepairer_dev` again as before and check if `output.ini` is now created.

---

**Summary:**  
By moving the `fclose(v);` to after all parsing and processing, you ensure the parser works correctly with both regular files and pipes, allowing tools like `earleyrepairer_dev` to function as intended.
